Problem 1.1: Online Shopping Cart
Scenario: Design a simplified online shopping cart system.

Requirements:

Create classes for Product (with attributes like id, name, price), and ShoppingCart.
The ShoppingCart should be able to:
Add products.
Remove products.
Calculate the total price of items in the cart.
Display the items currently in the cart.
OOP Concepts to Apply: Encapsulation, Basic Class Design, Methods.
LLD Considerations: Think about how data is stored and accessed within your classes.

Problem 1.2: Simple ATM Simulation
Scenario: Simulate a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine).
Requirements:

Create a BankAccount class with attributes like accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.
Implement methods for:
deposit(amount)
withdraw(amount) (consider insufficient funds)
getBalance()
Create an ATM class that interacts with a BankAccount. The ATM should have methods like:
checkBalance()
depositMoney()
withdrawMoney()
OOP Concepts to Apply: Encapsulation, Class Interaction, Basic Error Handling.
LLD Considerations: How do the ATM and BankAccount objects communicate?
